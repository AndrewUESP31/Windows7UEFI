# Windows7UEFI
A public repository with the x64 ISO of Windows 7 to be installed on UEFI systems. I'm not sure if the first ISO works but i will try. However, it's bootable.

This project was made with the help of ChatGPT.

Tools I used:

-A Windows 11 ISO
-The Windows 7 install.wim
-oscdimg for creating bootable iso
-UltraISO to check the ISO file
-Patched acpi.sys to prevent BSOD and a custom bootmgfw.efi

If some files are not updated i will fix later.
